# A-Network-analysis-of-Game-of-Thrones
In this project, you will look at the character co-occurrence network and its evolution over the five books in R.R. Martin's hugely popular book series **A Song of Ice and Fire** (perhaps better known as the TV show **Games of Thrones**). 
<br />
You will look at how the importance of the characters changes over the books using different centrality measures.

This project is part of Datacamp project https://www.datacamp.com/projects/76 using Python.
